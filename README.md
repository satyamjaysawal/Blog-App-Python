# Flask Blog App

## Overview

This is a simple blog application built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. Users can register, log in, and manage their posts seamlessly. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling and implements user authentication to protect certain functionalities.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (login/logout).
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Flash messages for user feedback.
- Pagination for blog posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing user and post data.
- **Flask-WTF**: Forms handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: CSS framework for styling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_blog.git
   cd flask_blog
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure you have an SQLite database configured. The application should create the necessary tables automatically when you run it for the first time.

5. **Set up environment variables**:
   You can create a `.env` file to store environment variables like `SECRET_KEY` for your application. Example:
   ```plaintext
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

- **Registration**: Users can register an account to start creating blog posts.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in to manage their posts.
- **Create Post**: After logging in, users can create new blog posts.
- **Edit Post**: Users can edit their posts as needed.
- **Delete Post**: Users can delete their posts if necessary.
- **View Posts**: All users can view the list of blog posts.

## Deployment

To deploy the application on a platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. Sign up or log in to your Vercel account.
2. Create a new project and link it to your GitHub repository.
3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard as needed.
4. Deploy the project. Vercel will automatically detect the Flask app and deploy it.
