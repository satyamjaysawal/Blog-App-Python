## Project Overview

The **Flask Blog Application** is a simple web-based platform that enables users to create, manage, and share blog posts.

### Key Features:

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create accounts and securely log in to manage their posts.
- **Post Management**: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their blog entries.
- **Responsive Design**: The application utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern user interface, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
- **Flash Messaging**: Users receive feedback through flash messages for actions such as successful logins, post creations, and deletions.
